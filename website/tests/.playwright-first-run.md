# First Time Running Playwright Tests

Welcome! This guide will help you run your first Playwright test.

## Step 1: Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
cd website
npx playwright install
```

This downloads Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers (~300MB).

## Step 2: Run Your First Test

```bash
npm test
```

This will:
1. Start the Vite dev server automatically
2. Run all tests in headless mode
3. Show results in the terminal

Expected output:
```
Running 66 tests using 5 workers

  âœ“ navigation.spec.js:10:5 â€º should display logo and navigation links (chromium)
  âœ“ navigation.spec.js:20:5 â€º should highlight active page (chromium)
  ...

  66 passed (2m)
```

## Step 3: Try Interactive Mode

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

This opens a UI where you can:
- See all tests
- Click to run individual tests
- Watch tests execute
- Time-travel through test steps
- Inspect elements

## Step 4: Run a Single Test File

```bash
npx playwright test navigation
```

This runs only the navigation tests (faster for development).

## Troubleshooting

### Port 5173 already in use
Stop your dev server if it's running manually:
```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
```

### Tests fail immediately
Make sure you're in the `website/` directory:
```bash
cd website
npm test
```

### Browser installation fails
Try installing with dependencies:
```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

## Next Steps

- Read [README.md](README.md) for detailed testing guide
- Check [../TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md) for full documentation
- Explore test files to understand patterns
- Try writing your own test!
